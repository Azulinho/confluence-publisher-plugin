<div>
  If checked, the plugin will continue publishing, even if the build was not successful.  In that case, you can use the <tt>${BUILD_RESULT}</tt> build variable to indicate the current build result.
  <p />
  If this box is <b>not</b> checked, then <tt>${BUILD_RESULT}</tt> can always only be "<tt>SUCCESS</tt>".
